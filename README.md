# Bluesky Translation Bot

This project is a bot built using the Bluesky SDK that listens for posts from accounts you follow, detects if they are in a different language (e.g., Dutch), translates them to English, and reposts the translated text to your bot's account. The bot aims to increase the reach of posts by allowing English speakers to read them.

## Features

- Listens for posts from accounts you follow.
- Detects posts in languages other than English (e.g., Dutch).
- Translates non-English posts to English.
- Reposts the translated text to the bot's account.
